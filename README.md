# A universal scale staff

A music notation alternative to the 5-lines staff, in which the **lines** are based directly on the **notes**.

The scale staff
---

The scale staff is an alternative notation for sheet music that allows an easier reading of notes on the scale, especially for beginners, but possibly for musicians as well.

In standard music notations, the notes are represented on a staff of 5 equally-spaced lines. The staff is drawn with a Clef, which sets the reference for notes : E is the note of the lower line of the Treble Clef.

The scale staff, instead, is drawn with a thick line on every C note and a thin line on every G.

On a whole octave :

The lines can be also be drawn as high or low as needed to cover the range of notes in the score.

Compare the standard two-staff for the piano :

with the equivalent with the scale staff :

Certainly, for a beginner there is a simplification in the reading of notes : knowing the Treble Clef and Bass Clef is not needed.
