# Simplifying music reading

The "simple staff" is a proposal for an alternative music notation. In particular, it is a prosposal to replace the 5-lines staff by a simple staff, in which the **lines** relate directly on the **notes**, accross all pitches.
The goal is to make reading notes easier, especially for beginners, but possibly for experienced musicians as well.

The simple staff
---

In standard music notations, the notes are represented on a staff of 5 equally-spaced lines. The staff is drawn with a Clef, which sets the reference for notes : for example E is the note of the lower line of the Treble Clef.

The scale staff, instead, is drawn with a thick line on every C note and a thin line on every F.

**I have just decided to move the thin line from G (previously) to F, for aesthetic purposes. The pictures and examples will be inconsistent until I fix all of this.**

On a whole octave :

The lines can be also be drawn as high or low as needed to cover the range of notes in the score.

Compare the standard two-staff for the piano :

with the equivalent with the scale staff :

Certainly, for a beginner there is a simplification in the reading of notes : knowing the Treble Clef and Bass Clef is not needed.
