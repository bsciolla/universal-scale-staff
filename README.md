# A universal scale staff

A music notation alternative to the 5-lines staff, in which the lines are based directly on the notes.

The scale staff : what it is
---

The scale staff is an alternative notation for sheet music that allows an easier reading of notes on the scale, especially for beginners, but possibly for musicians as well.

In standard music notations, the notes are represented on a staff of 5 equally-spaced lines. The staff is drawn with a Clef, which sets the reference for notes : E is the note of the lower line of the Treble Clef.

The scale staff, instead, is drawn with a thick line on every C note and a thin line on every G.

On a whole octave :

The lines can be also be drawn as high or low as needed to cover the range of notes in the score.

Compare the standard two-staff for the piano :

with the equivalent with the scale staff :

Certainly, for a beginner there is a simplification in the reading of notes : knowing the Treble Clef and Bass Clef is not needed.

Also, the pattern repeats accross all octaves. Notice that in this notation, the location of individual notes is not changed : the 5 lines of the staff are simply omitted and replaced by the scale staff lines.


The Treble, Bass or other Clefs are drawn to set the absolute pitch reference.

You can see the result of two scales on a piano in scales.png.

Handel_Sarabande.png shows how one can decide which lines to show or hide, to have a light display and good readability.

After some training, one quickly learns to recognize notes that are one top or below the C/G lines (see Training.png), allowing to skip more lines.

On the exquisite Chopin Op9 n2, one can see that the pitch staff notation is readable for more sophisticated music pieces.
In particular, even a beginner can easily find notes of the same pitch on different octaves for the right hand and the left hand. To do this on a standard score, one has to be experienced in reading the piano C Clef and G Clef.

This pitch staff notation can apply to any score, for any instrument. With this, learning notes on the different clefs is not needed anymore, and musicians don't need to specialize in reading on treble, alto, tenor and bass clefs : all scores look alike.

On the demo "Octaves.png", it's visible that very high or low pitches are much easier to read.
The pitch staff also avoids a very unpleasant feature of regular-spaced lines used in the standard staff :
- the pitch C4 is on a line
- the pitch C5 is between two lines
- the pitch C6 is again on a line, etc.
To my knowledge, there is no music theory argument in favor of this "even/odd" effect. It is only caused by the fact that the 5-lines staff uses uniform, regular lines spacing (the 5 lines are equidistant, and the lines drawn below and above are also equally spaced).
Because the standard score is "designed" for heptatonic scales, the octave is found after 7 intervals, so drawing lines at regular one-jump spacing (for the major scale : C, then E, then G, etc.) leads to C's alternating on and off the line accross different octaves.
This is why learning pitches in the 5-lines staff is a long process : because there is no repeating pattern accross the octaves.
